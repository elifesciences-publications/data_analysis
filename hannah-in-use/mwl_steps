steps to analyze eeg:
1) use eeg2mat to convert file into an eeg structure
for ex:
	eegdata = eeg2mat('arte_lfp1.eeg', [7], 'bt|3',[0 276971379831008359]);
	%  Takes channel 7 from data, uses timestamps (t), prints out all
	%  processes (3), and starts at first time stamp and ends at last. TS info
	%  and other stuff can be found by using the verbose print option 3

2) use imcont to convert to continuous structure
for ex:
	cont = imcont('eeg',eegdata, 'timeunits','timestamps');
	%  this specifies unit is timestamps in accordance with above conversion

getting:
** Warning: max error in computed timestamp will be greater than 50%
of samplerate resolution!!!--try converting as subsets of data? 
> In imcont (line 466) 

3) find out sample rate from eeg2mat file
	eeg.samplefreq
Think the above will always be 750
For some reason the cont filt prints it wrong-- doing cont.samplerate gives some weird small number
Manually enter the samplerate using
	cont.samplerate = 750

4) make filter
for ex:
	rip = filtoptdefs('ripple')
OR do manually with sample rate
	rip = mkfiltopt('name','ripple','Fs',750,'filttype','bandpass','F',[100 150 250 300])

5) filter with contfilt
	filtered = contfilt(cont, 'filtopt',rip);


PROBLEM-- for some channels the gains are being read in as 0 when you do eeg2mat
