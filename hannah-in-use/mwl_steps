steps to analyze eeg:
1) use eeg2mat to convert file into an eeg structure
for ex:
eegdata = eeg2mat('arte_lfp1.eeg', [7], 'bt|3',[0 276971379831008359]);
%  Takes channel 7 from data, uses timestamps (t), prints out all
%  processes (3), and starts at first time stamp and ends at last. TS info
%  and other stuff can be found by using the verbose print option 3

2) use imcont to convert to continuous structure
for ex: cont = imcont('eeg',eeg, 'timeunits','timestamps');
%  this specifies unit is timestamps in accordance with above conversion

3) find out sample rate
contstructure.samplerate
(wtf unit is this??? says .0057/second but that is miniscule and means my nyquist frequency makes no sense. if i make it 5700 i get an error when i run contfilt.m that my frequencies don't match)

4) make filter
for ex: rip = filtoptdefs('ripple')
OR do manually with sample rate
rip = mkfiltopt('name','ripple','Fs',5700,'filttype','bandpass','F',[100 150 250 300])

5) do something with contfilt.m kind of stuck bc of sample rate problems, see #3. tbc.....
>> contyfilter = contfilt(cont,'filt',mkfiltout);
	Error using contfilt>subf_contfilter (line 131) samplerate of 	
	filter doesn't match data, use a filtopt struct instead
