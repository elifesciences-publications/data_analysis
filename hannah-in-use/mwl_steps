steps to analyze eeg:
1) use eeg2mat to convert file into an eeg structure
for ex:
eegdata = eeg2mat('arte_lfp1.eeg', [7], 'bt|3',[0 276971379831008359]);
%  Takes channel 7 from data, uses timestamps (t), prints out all
%  processes (3), and starts at first time stamp and ends at last. TS info
%  and other stuff can be found by using the verbose print option 3

2) use imcont to convert to continuous structure
for ex: cont = imcont('eeg',eeg, 'timeunits','timestamps');
%  this specifies unit is timestamps in accordance with above conversion

3) make filter
for ex: rip = filtoptdefs('ripple')
