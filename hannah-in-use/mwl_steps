steps to analyze eeg:

---- For ARTE:
1) Use gh_debuffer to import file to matlab format
[lfp.timestamp, lfp.data, ~] = gh_debuffer('filename.eeg','system', 'arte', 'gains',5000,'timewin',[start end]);
time is in seconds, can use 0, inf for time to import all









---- For AD:
1) use eeg2mat to convert file into an eeg structure
for ex:
	eegdata = eeg2mat('arte_lfp1.eeg', [7], 'bt|3',[0 276971379831008359]);
	%  Takes channel 7 from data, uses timestamps (t), prints out all
	%  processes (3), and starts at first time stamp and ends at last. TS info
	%  and other stuff can be found by using the verbose print option 3

2) use imcont to convert to continuous structure
for ex:
	cont = imcont('eeg',eegdata, 'timeunits','timestamps');
	%  this specifies unit is timestamps in accordance with above conversion

getting:
** Warning: max error in computed timestamp will be greater than 50%
of samplerate resolution!!!--try converting as subsets of data? 
> In imcont (line 466) 

3) find out sample rate from eeg2mat file
	eeg.samplefreq
Think the above will always be 750
For some reason the cont filt prints it wrong-- doing cont.samplerate gives some weird small number
Manually enter the samplerate using
	cont.samplerate = 750
And manually change gains bc wtf

4) make filter
for ex:
	rip = filtoptdefs('ripple')
OR do manually with sample rate
	rip = mkfiltopt('name','ripple','Fs',750,'filttype','bandpass','F',[100 150 250 300])

5) filter with contfilt
	filtered = contfilt(cont, 'filtopt',rip);

6) find ripples? starting points:
mwl-fabian/fkDataAnalysis/process_eeg_ripples.m
mwl-stuart/thesis-analysis-code/Ripple_Figures/detectRipples.m
mwl-stuart/thesis-analysis-code/MultiUnitRipplesAndSpindles/detect_ripples.m (multiunit)
mwl-stuart/thesis-analysis-code/Utilities/find_rip_burst.m
mwl-gh-code/ripple_analysis/ripplesFromEEG.m
mwl-gh-code/tetrode-analysis-matlab/ripples/eegRipples.m


PROBLEM-- for some channels the gains are being read in as 0 when you do eeg2mat
