steps to analyze eeg:

---- For ARTE:
1) Use gh_debuffer to import file to matlab format.
time is in seconds, can use 0, inf for time to import all.
ex:
>> [lfp.timestamp, lfp.data, ~] = gh_debuffer('arte_lfp1.eeg', 'system','arte','gains',5000, 'chans', [7],'timewin',[0,inf]);

can plot then with 
>> plot(lfp.timestamp, lfp.data)
and zoom with
>> zoom xon 

2) filter with fir and a blackman window using ripfilt.m
ex:
filtdata = ripfilt(lfp.data);

3) do a hilbert transformation on data and grab transformed data
ex:
>> h = hilbert(filtdata);
>> trans = abs(h);

4) find three std devs above mean
m = mean(trans) + (std(trans).*3);

 next: filter with fir and blackman filter. do a hilbert transform to envelope. find mean-- ripples are 3+ deviations above mean. code ripple start and stop times as starting and ending at standard dev. ripple time is peak of ripple
