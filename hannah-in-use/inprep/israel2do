Figure out how to lowpass and denoise velocity and acceleration data
adjust filters to counteract timeshift from group delay
Rerun all my claims with fixed velocity script
cap velocity/acc in accelVsFiringRate (might be taken care of by doing the above)
rewrite spikeprobrun to be modular
figure out lag btwn hpc and ls: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600317
